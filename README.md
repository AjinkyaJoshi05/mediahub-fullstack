# videoverse-Fullstack

my backend is for a youtube clone (+ a tweet functoinality). users can login, post videos , watch videos, like and comment subscribe and also post tweets. i made it in such a way that once it is complete, i can add a few extra features like membership (paid, to integrate a payment gateway using razorpay webhook), and i had a small idea of adding a small chatbot (using Gpt or gemini api key) it will help do sentiment analysis of the comments on a video, give insights to creators
